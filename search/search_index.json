Our objective? To dive deep into understanding how land policies affect water governance. Our focus was on two vital Indonesian rivers: the Kali Code in central Yogyakarta and the Kali Ciliwung in Jakarta. The students were grouped in teams and our team members for this blog are Alek, Alson and Lawrence.</p> <p>Teaming up with Universitas Gadjah Mada (UGM), we set out a clear mission to uncover the intricate relationship between land policies and the management of water resources in Indonesia. We spent our days deeply engaged, interacting with locals, policymakers, and experts intimately familiar with the complexities of water governance.</p> <p>We explored how housing policies shaped lives, observed the myriad ways water was used in these bustling towns, and dived into conversations about Normalisation and Naturalisation - ways to restore and integrate rivers into Indonesian life.</p> <p>Our discussions were not just academic. They were rooted in the stories and dreams of those directly impacted by these policies. The knowledge we acquired was truly invaluable.</p> <p>A massive shout-out goes to our incredible hosts, the inspiring professors, and the dedicated facilitators who made this eye-opening journey possible. We can't thank Navarun Varma, Ph.D., and the amazing minds at Universitas Gadjah Mada (UGM) enough for guiding us every step of the way.</p> <p>This trip was not just about academic exploration. It was about envisioning a future where these lesser-known regions thrive sustainably, becoming models of harmonious coexistence with nature. As we reminisce about our experiences, we\u2019re eagerly looking forward to creating a video that captures the heart and soul of our journey.</p> <p>Our team created a montage to encapsulate what we have experience during the trip.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"#some-snippets-of-the-trip","title":"Some snippets of the trip","text":""},{"location":"closing/","title":"Closing Thoughts","text":"<p>This section is an informal one, we felt the need to add in some personal thoughts that are beyond just \u201cacademics\u201d. Since the start of the trip, before it was labelled an SSU, our group had an open mind and simply wanted to have fun and learn. Unexpectedly (and fortunately), the trip really opened our horizons into the realities of the world and kept us abreast of governance issues. As the trip went on, our team became obsessed with the plaguing issues, and we wanted to really break down and investigate every component to fault-find. </p> <p>To be honest, we approached it in a very logical and humanistic point of view, not necessarily a system thinking one. That is why we talked about housing issues (land policies) and inadequacies in government since Jogja, it was purely based on instinct and observation. Hence, our group were quick to say, \u201chold on, isn\u2019t this just Singapore but 60 years ago?\u201d. We got more and more interested in what we were learning and were asking everyone tons of questions, trying to formulate good solutions (that fit the Indo perspectives) and justify our thought process.</p> <p>Nevertheless, much work needs to be done and we certainly want to incorporate more system thinking dynamics into our ideas. The trip was sincerely a very fun one and it is the paragon of learning outside of the classroom. A business student, a computer science student, and an engineering student walked into Indonesia to study policymaking and factors surrounding governance and communities (what? That\u2019s crazy).</p> <p>All in all, the 12 days trip in Indonesia was an eye-opening and memorable trip. We enjoyed every bit of it and the trip shaped our perspectives. There were many first during the trip. In fact, it was Alek\u2019s first time riding a train (other than MRT in Singapore), first time our team were holding on to dear life during the jeep ride, our first time drinking spring water. The trip was enjoyable for Lawrence as he has the love and passion for coffee, often talking to villagers about coffee and even bought their coffee to support their business. In addition, he also shared his knowledge about coffee to the students. </p> <p>The trip was not possible without the help of Professor Navarun, two student assistants - Grace Ng and  Atmaja \u2013 and the students and staff of UGM. We would like to offer our appreciation to them. Their dedications and contributions made this adventure truly unforgettable.</p>"},{"location":"game/","title":"Game Based Model","text":""},{"location":"game/#game-design","title":"Game Design","text":"<p>To vividly illustrate the challenges, we propose the creation of a game that immerses players in the complexities of water governance in river communities. As we have identified the potential solution of a centralised government, the implementation of our sequential relocation and clean-up can be its focus on how to best relocate settlers. Through strategic thinking and problem-solving, players navigate the management of a river ecosystem, addressing pollution, and handling community resistance to relocation. This interactive game serves as a tool to raise awareness and promote understanding of sustainable solutions for river ecosystems.</p>"},{"location":"intro/","title":"Introduction","text":""},{"location":"intro/#introduction","title":"Introduction","text":"<p>From tiny droplets to expansive river deltas, the connection between water and river communities is deeply woven into the fabric of Indonesian life and has a profound impact on land policies in river governance. This influence is particularly pronounced in Kali Ciliwung, where the local population has adapted to annual floods, resisting relocation due to the river's sentimental value and community ties. This resistance extends to unsuccessful attempts to relocate settlers and corporate entities in the region, resulting in a decline in the river's environmental health and prospects for tourism. In this entry, we will delve into the potential consequences of redesigning green spaces, leading to distress migration and a potential decline in residents' quality of life. We will also explore how implementing various policies from Singapore could address these challenges and propose a game design to substantiate our hypotheses.</p>"},{"location":"pollution/","title":"Origin of pollution","text":""},{"location":"pollution/#origin-of-pollution","title":"Origin of pollution","text":"<p>Also known as \u201cKali Besar\u201d (Big River), Kali Ciliwung was a strategic location for trade since pre-colonial times in Batavia. The governance of the river from up to downstream is split between 3 municipal governments (refer to annex 1). Kali Ciliwung consists of 2 main tributaries, Kali Ciesek and Kali Ciluar, and it originates from Mt. Mandala Wangi which is governed by the Bogor Regency government.  In Bogor, land use near its source heavily features agriculture and urban developments (refer to annexe 2). Pollution of Kali Ciliwung starts in this region where industrial, population, livestock and chemical wastes which come from its inhabitants contaminate its waters. This can be seen in the significant introduction of 185.62 kg/hr of BOD and 374.598 kg/hr of COD from liquid waste around Bogor alone (refer to annexe 3). Compared to its midstream which is governed by the Depok City government, although being one of West Java\u2019s most populated cities contributes only 4.68 kg/hr of BOD and 7.56 kg/hr of COD. It\u2019s downstream in DKI Jakarta which has a similar population constitution as Bogor contributes a lesser 23.4 kg/hr of BOD and 51.3 kg/hr of COD. </p> <p> </p> Annex 1 <p>Despite the implementation of river clean-up initiatives by the three governing bodies in their respective regions, a 2017 report from the Jakarta Environmental Agency underscores the persistent and substantial pollution of Kali Ciliwung. Notably, 80% of the documented pollution is attributed to household or domestic waste. The situation is further compounded by annual floods impacting the mid and downstream regions, resulting in the deposition of trash along the riverbanks and posing a direct threat to the safety of informal settlements in these areas. </p> <p> </p> Annex 2 <p>Notably within the region of Jakarta, the local governing body aims to resettle slums to build a seawall to keep the rising sea levels out and therefore receives a larger distribution of funds from the national government compared to other municipalities. As a result, regions such as Depok City get a small slice of the pie and have cited a lack of funds as a factor for inefficient implementation of relocation plans.</p> <p> </p> Annex 3 <p>This extends to working relationships between regional governments which are strained, often citing pollution in other sections of the river as a rationale for their inability to effectively address the issue, thereby neglecting the cumulative consequences from their specific jurisdiction. Local communities have also expressed concerns towards this, citing that their regional government have given up due to the river already being polluted.</p> <p>The complexity is further heightened by unclear land ownership rights, complicating the resettlement process. Notably, the qualification for residency in public housing (Rusunawas). As the allocation of stay within a Rusnawa and compensation plans are based on being able to provide adequate proof of land ownership within areas that will be relocated, the majority of illegal settlers who have immigrated from other provinces may not be able to qualify for this scheme.  This adds to the challenge of relocation as local governments who want to resettle the population will face difficulties in distinguishing between legal and illegal settlers. If a forceful relocation was conducted it may result in their displacement without an alternative place of residence, potentially leading to their return to the same riverbanks. </p> <p>More Factors for Pollution</p>"},{"location":"pollution/#issue-1-lack-of-coordination-conflicting-interests-of-governing-bodies","title":"Issue 1 - Lack of Coordination &amp; Conflicting interests of governing bodies","text":"<p>Efforts to address environmental degradation through the relocation of households have been a focal point for the governing bodies, particularly in areas prone to pollution and flooding. However, the successful execution of these policies is hindered by inadequate coordination. This lack of coordination stems from the unequal distribution of funding among the local governing bodies responsible for implementing relocation efforts and conflicting regional interests. </p>"},{"location":"pollution/#issue-2-social-capital-and-challenges-towards-relocation","title":"Issue 2 - Social capital and Challenges towards relocation","text":"<p>The relocation of residents to public housing such as Rusanawas faces substantial challenges due to the influential role played by local communities in shaping policy decisions. The resistance to relocation from areas at risk is rooted in the communal and sentimental value attached to these rivers by the local community. This extends to communities who have been relocated feeling like they have lost more by moving to a Rusanawa than by staying in an area which is flood-prone particularly in the middle and downstream.</p>"},{"location":"prob/","title":"Problems Identified & Potential Solutions","text":""},{"location":"prob/#problems-and-solutions","title":"Problems and Solutions","text":""},{"location":"prob/#problems-identified","title":"Problems Identified","text":"<p>The first problem that we should address is the lack of a centralised form of government that prioritises the health and management of the river as a whole. This will allow a coordinated effort in Kali Ciliwung to focus on a collective initiative for all regions instead of allowing regional needs or funding differences due to various justifications to hold priority. Secondly, the proper incentives to incentivise settlers who are living in unsuitable areas to relocate. This will be particularly challenging as the team will need to take a multi-pronged approach to convince settlers who are so entrenched in their current culture and way of living. Lastly, a suitable sequence of implementation for relocation should be considered to minimise stresses from the redesign of green spaces to the population. </p>"},{"location":"prob/#potential-solution","title":"Potential Solution","text":"<p>Although government help for clean-up has had challenges. Communities along Kali Ciliwung have been actively involved in the conservation, education, and clean-up efforts of Kali Ciliwung. One notable instance is the Komunitas Ciliwung Depok, which actively manages its local freshwater sources, partakes in farming for protection and conservation and educates Depok residents about the significance of Kali Ciliwung. These endeavours have effectively reduced river waste and fostered a more environmentally conscious community. Another case is Dompet Dhuafa and the downstream residents of Kali Ciliwung, who independently combat upstream pollution, promote tourism and innovate conservation methods without government assistance. Despite facing legal challenges, engaging local and international audiences, and experimenting with riverfront protection initiatives like bamboo projects, this community displays remarkable resilience in adverse conditions.</p> <p>These successes are potential solutions that can be utilised in the formulation of our over-arching plans for the region, in particular leveraging on the existing propensity of locals to participate in communal initiatives which include the promotion of tourism.</p>"},{"location":"prob/#singaporean-solutions-that-have-proven-effective","title":"Singaporean Solutions that have proven effective","text":"<p>As a guideline, the Singapore River cleanup can serve as a foundation for a more streamlined relocation strategy, beginning with the Housing Development Board (HDB) program for resettling inhabitants and concluding with the potential establishment of a dedicated tourism region facilitated by park connectors.</p> <p>The Singapore River cleanup, spanning from 1977 to 1987, focused on eliminating sources of pollution, clearing river debris, and establishing proper sewage infrastructure. Simultaneously, the government relocated more than 40,000 illegal squatters to HDBs, impacting over 26,000 families, and providing monetary compensation as part of the pollution source removal efforts.</p> <p>Moreover, the cleanup initiative augmented land value around the river, leading to investments that catalysed tourism and business activities. The development of areas like Marina Bay became possible due to the successful mitigation of pollution in the region.</p> <p>The Housing Development Board (HDB), established in 1960, addressed Singapore's housing shortage crisis by constructing simple, cost-effective apartments. In response to issues such as overpopulation, high unemployment, and inadequate housing in 1959, the HDB played a pivotal role in swiftly rehousing illegal settlers along the river. This initiative significantly improved living standards and contributed to the effective cleanup of the river.</p> <p>With the resolution of illegal settlements and river pollution, Singapore implemented the Park Connector Network (PCN) to further enhance riverbanks. Introduced in 1992, the PCN has completed over 300 kilometres of park connectors, fostering recreational and social activities along water bodies. This initiative promotes environmental sustainability, reduces the local heat island effect, and provides habitats for native bird species, contributing positively to the ecosystem. The PCN has successfully encouraged community engagement through activities like jogging and cycling, creating a sense of belonging among residents.</p>"},{"location":"proposedsolution/","title":"Proposed Solutions","text":""},{"location":"proposedsolution/#proposed-solutions","title":"Proposed Solutions","text":"<p>Primarily, our team advocates for the establishment of a unified governing body for Kali Ciliwung, aspiring to elevate the river to the status of a national level \"Special Region\" with distinct legal rights and living status. Drawing inspiration from Singapore's successful experience, this political manoeuvre aims to catalyse effective collaboration and policy implementation. Given Indonesia's challenge of fragmented river management across state boundaries, treating the entire river as a single entity empowers the governing body to set comprehensive guidelines and override lower political tiers. This strategic move lays the groundwork for achieving our broader objectives and exporting Singapore's successful strategies.</p> <p>Indonesia can draw valuable insights from Singapore's achievements, emphasizing pragmatic policies, forward-looking approaches, long-term planning, and political determination. Establishing a national-level \"Special Region\" for rivers could facilitate seamless long-term planning and development without hindrance from multiple government levels or stakeholders. Initial steps involve constructing additional public housing to accommodate illegal settlers. Subsequently, as the first phase concludes, the government can undertake river cleanup and relocate settlements to the newly built public housing. Finally, with housing shortages and river pollution addressed, the government can transform the riverbanks into community spaces akin to Singapore's Park Connector Network (PCN), enhancing social interaction and environmental sustainability. This approach makes the river more appealing to locals and tourists, contributing to increased tourism and economic development.</p>"},{"location":"proposedsolution/#one-united-government-at-the-national-level","title":"One United Government at the National Level","text":"<p>Firstly, our team believes in trying to achieve one united governing body for Kali Ciliwung. In this aspect, we intend to make the river a national level \u201cSpecial Region\u201d with its own legal rights and living status. This political move will create the impetus for effective collaboration and policy implementation without any barriers from multilevel governments or stakeholders. This lesson is one that Singapore had learnt through her years of rapid development. As the issue in Indonesia is poor co-management of the river across state boundaries and jurisdictions, having the entire river (including its pristine source) considered one entity allows the river governing body to set clear guidelines in river management and veto the lower political echelons. This sets the precedence for the rest of our goals of exporting Singapore\u2019s successes.</p>"},{"location":"proposedsolution/#public-housing-and-relocation","title":"Public Housing and Relocation","text":"<p>The first step that should be taken is for the government to build more public housing to accommodate illegal settlers. We might not have spoken to illegal settlers but from our other interactions, we understand that illegal settlers live in precarious informal housing along Kaly Codi and Kaly Ciliwung due to the lack of formal legal housing. Similarly in Singapore, there were over 400,000 settlers along the Singapore river in 1977. As compared to locals, these settlers do not treat the rivers with the same level of care and respect. Additionally, their daily activities and habits, more often than not, pollute the environment around them. This is polar opposite from the Betawi culture that we understand from mid-stream and down-stream. By relocating settlers, we pave the way for better management of the river. </p>"},{"location":"proposedsolution/#setting-up-of-industries-and-stringent-enforcement","title":"Setting up of Industries and Stringent Enforcement","text":"<p>From our tour of Kali Ciliwung, we came to know of illegal home businesses that damage the environment. Further upstream, there are also factories which were blamed for the poor state of water and land surrounding the river. As industries are built on private lands, local communities have no choice but to endure the degradation of soil and water quality as a result of their advent. Businesses also engage in bribery to avoid facing repercussions of their actions. From our united government plans, this issue will be simpler to solve. We believe that industries should have their own areas to function in, like the Jurong Industrial Area and Pasir Panjang Ports if we were to compare to Singapore and how the country relocated shipyards, wholesalers, and home industries.</p> <p>By having a unified governing body for the river, rules can be made and enforced much easier as compared to current situation. One good example is Mt Pagrango. The rangers have full authority over the nature park and this legality allows them to control and preserve the natural environment in Bogor. More can be explored in this area for sure. For example, by removing legal loopholes and not incentivising negative behaviours.</p>"},{"location":"proposedsolution/#river-cleanups","title":"River Cleanups","text":"<p>Not only should we continue to educate and encourage behavioural change, but by relocating the people living and working along the river, we create opportunities to renew its state. By piggybacking on existing community cleanup and preservation efforts, we envision a river as clean as it was before. This has a two-fold benefit. One, the floods which were worsened due to pollution will be lessened. Two, the entire river community can be refreshed for our vision, elaborated in the next sections, to become a reality. Indonesia is better than Singapore in the past as we did not have local communities that were preserving the life of the river. It was only due to sheer political will and enforcement that we made progress (not to mention the initial failures). Hence, with the spirit of the locals in Indonesia, more can be done in shorter amounts of time.</p>"},{"location":"proposedsolution/#creating-communities","title":"Creating Communities","text":"<p>As we saw from the kampongs around the Garuda Wall project, the locals saw positivity in new situations. The best example of this is shown from the building of concrete structures as coastal protection. Although it interferes with their lives, they take advantage of the new structures to use as community facilities like new gathering grounds, which was truly astonishing to see. Hence, we wish to build unified communities around the river by providing appropriate housing and recreational facilities. In this aspect, we propose to link the country up with a Park Connector Network(PCN) system. This mirrors the PCNs of Singapore where we link towns together, creating beautiful and natural travel routes across the country, accessible by foot. Structures do not have to be boring and mundane; they can be integrated within the fabric of society and livelihood. It is not about \u201cnormalisation\u201d or \u201cnaturalisation\u201d but having a good blend of solutions. This also achieves our next two goals.</p>"},{"location":"proposedsolution/#protection-and-security","title":"Protection and Security","text":"<p>From the lava flows in Kali Code to the floods in Kali Ciliwung, we must address the need to secure the lives and property of the riverbanks. Instead of having structures, we hope that having PCNs and natural greenery can help alleviate damages to the riverbank. From our observations, space is not an issue. It is simply a design issue and poor planning that had led to terrible living conditions and constant threat of loss of lives and property from disasters. In downstream Ciliwung, the locals even showed us the structures that the governments built. Stretches of concrete walls that was built by chopping down natural greenery in the area -they are indeed \u201cmonuments of stupidity\u201d. By adopting the PCN design, it creates natural safety distances and community building opportunities.</p>"},{"location":"proposedsolution/#tourism-and-empowering-the-locals","title":"Tourism and Empowering the locals","text":"<p>Speaking to the locals in Kali Code, we understand that most of the people living in river communities make a living by selling food or working blue-collared jobs. In Kali Ciliwung, we observe that the locals empower themselves in many aspects as mentioned in the front of our reflection, from education to preservation. The most salient example of empowerment is in downstream Ciliwung. We see their dreams and vision of transforming Ciliwung into a tourist destination that is known internationally. They are capable of conservation, water rescue, education, and many more useful skills that are necessary for tourism. There is so many missed opportunities for the people there when we compare them to river communities worldwide (e.g. Thailand). Empowering them to come out of the poverty cycle and to benefit from the rejuvenation of the rivers is a vision that we believe will happen, much like Singapore.</p>"},{"location":"ref/","title":"References","text":""},{"location":"ref/#references","title":"References","text":"<p>Djadjadilaga, M., Sigit, H. and Tejalaksana, A.
