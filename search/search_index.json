Our objective? To dive deep into understanding how land policies affect water governance. Our focus was on two vital Indonesian rivers: the Kali Code in central Yogyakarta and the Kali Ciliwung in Jakarta. The students were grouped in teams and our team members for this blog are Alek, Alson and Lawrence.</p> <p>Teaming up with Universitas Gadjah Mada (UGM), we set out a clear mission to uncover the intricate relationship between land policies and the management of water resources in Indonesia. We spent our days deeply engaged, interacting with locals, policymakers, and experts intimately familiar with the complexities of water governance.</p> <p>We explored how housing policies shaped lives, observed the myriad ways water was used in these bustling towns, and dived into conversations about Normalisation and Naturalisation - ways to restore and integrate rivers into Indonesian life.</p> <p>Our discussions were not just academic. They were rooted in the stories and dreams of those directly impacted by these policies. The knowledge we acquired was truly invaluable.</p> <p>A massive shout-out goes to our incredible hosts, the inspiring professors, and the dedicated facilitators who made this eye-opening journey possible. We can't thank Navarun Varma, Ph.D., and the amazing minds at Universitas Gadjah Mada (UGM) enough for guiding us every step of the way.</p> <p>This trip was not just about academic exploration. It was about envisioning a future where these lesser-known regions thrive sustainably, becoming models of harmonious coexistence with nature. As we reminisce about our experiences, we\u2019re eagerly looking forward to creating a video that captures the heart and soul of our journey.</p> <p>Our team created a montage to encapsulate what we have experience during the trip.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"#some-snippets-of-the-trip","title":"Some snippets of the trip","text":""},{"location":"closing/","title":"Closing Thoughts","text":"<p><sup>_</sup> This section is an informal one, we felt the need to add in some personal thoughts that are beyond just \u201cacademics\u201d. Since the start of the trip, before it was labelled an SSU, our group had an open mind and simply wanted to have fun and learn. Unexpectedly (and fortunately), the trip really broaden our horizons into the realities of the world and kept us abreast of governance issues. As the trip went on, our team became obsessed with the plaguing issues, and we wanted to really break down and investigate every component to fault-find. </p> <p>To be honest, we approached it in a very logical and humanistic point of view, not necessarily a system thinking one. That is why we talked about housing issues (land policies) and inadequacies in government since Jogja, it was purely based on instinct and observation. Hence, our group was quick to say, \u201chold on, isn\u2019t this just Singapore but 60 years ago?\u201d. We got more and more interested in what we were learning and were asking everyone tons of questions, trying to formulate good solutions (that fit the Indo perspectives) and justify our thoughts.</p> <p>Nevertheless, much work needs to be done and we certainly want to incorporate more system thinking dynamics into our ideas. The trip was sincerely a very fun one and it is the paragon of learning outside of the classroom. A business student, a computer science student, and an engineering student walked into Indonesia to study policymaking and factors surrounding governance and communities (what? That\u2019s crazy).</p> <p>All in all, the 12-day trip to Indonesia was an eye-opening and memorable trip. We enjoyed every bit of it, and the trip shaped our perspectives. There were many firsts during the journey. It was Alek\u2019s first time riding a train (other than the MRT in Singapore), the first time our team were holding on to dear life during the jeep ride, and our first time drinking spring water. The trip was enjoyable for Lawrence as he has a love and passion for coffee, often talking to villagers about it and even buying it to support their business. In addition, he also shared his knowledge about coffee to the students. </p> <p>The trip would not have been possible without the help of Professor Navarun, two student assistants - Grace Ng and  Atmaja \u2013 and the students and staff of UGM. We want to offer our appreciation to them. Their dedication and contributions made this adventure truly unforgettable.</p>"},{"location":"game/","title":"Game Based Model","text":""},{"location":"game/#game-design","title":"Game Design","text":"<p>To vividly illustrate the challenges, we propose the creation of a game that immerses players in the complexities of water governance in river communities. As we have identified the potential solution of a centralised government, the implementation of our sequential relocation and clean-up can be its focus on how to best relocate settlers. Through strategic thinking and problem-solving, players navigate the management of a river ecosystem, addressing pollution, and handling community resistance to relocation.

This influence is particularly pronounced in Kali Ciliwung, where the local population has adapted to annual floods, resisting relocation due to the river's sentimental value and community ties. This resistance extends to unsuccessful attempts to relocate settlers and corporate entities in the region, resulting in a decline in the river's environmental health and prospects for tourism. In this entry, we will delve into the potential consequences of redesigning green spaces, leading to distress migration and a potential decline in residents' quality of life. We will also explore how implementing various policies in Singapore could address these challenges and propose a game design to substantiate our hypotheses.</p>"},{"location":"pollution/","title":"Origin of pollution","text":""},{"location":"pollution/#origin-of-pollution","title":"Origin of pollution","text":"<p>Also known as \u201cKali Besar\u201d (Big River), Kali Ciliwung was a strategic location for trade since pre-colonial times in Batavia. The governance of the river from up to downstream is split between three municipal governments (refer to Annex 1). Kali Ciliwung consists of two main tributaries, Kali Ciesek and Kali Ciluar, and it originates from Mt. Mandala Wangi, which is governed by the Bogor Regency government.</p> <p>In Bogor, land use near its source heavily features agriculture and urban developments (refer to Annex 2). Pollution in Kali Ciliwung starts in this region, where industrial, population, livestock, and chemical wastes that come from its inhabitants contaminate its waters. This can be seen in the significant introduction of 185.62 kg/hr of BOD and 374.598 kg/hr of COD from liquid waste around Bogor alone (refer to Annex 3). Compared to its midstream, which is governed by the Depok City government, although being one of West Java\u2019s most populated cities, it contributes only 4.68 kg/hr of BOD and 7.56 kg/hr of COD. It\u2019s downstream in DKI Jakarta, which has a similar population constitution, as Bogor contributes a lesser 23.4 kg/hr of BOD and 51.3 kg/hr of COD.</p> <p> </p> Annex 1 <p>Despite the implementation of river clean-up initiatives by the three governing bodies in their respective regions, a 2017 report from the Jakarta Environmental Agency underscores the persistent and substantial pollution of Kali Ciliwung. Notably, 80% of the documented pollution is attributed to household or domestic waste. The situation is further compounded by annual floods impacting the mid- and downstream regions, resulting in the deposition of trash along the riverbanks and posing a direct threat to the safety of informal settlements in these areas.</p> <p> </p> Annex 2 <p>More Factors for Pollution</p>"},{"location":"pollution/#issue-1-lack-of-coordination-conflicting-interests-of-governing-bodies","title":"Issue 1 - Lack of Coordination &amp; Conflicting interests of governing bodies","text":"<p>Efforts to address environmental degradation through the relocation of households have been a focal point for the governing bodies, particularly in areas prone to pollution and flooding. However, the successful execution of these policies is hindered by inadequate coordination. This lack of coordination stems from the unequal distribution of funding among the local governing bodies responsible for implementing relocation efforts and conflicting regional interests.</p> <p>Notably, within the region of Jakarta, the local governing body aims to resettle slums and build a seawall to keep the rising sea levels out under \"Normalisation.\" It therefore receives a larger distribution of funds from the national government compared to other municipalities. In other regions, such as Depok City, the regional government gets a small slice of the pie and has cited a lack of funds as a factor in the inefficient implementation of relocation plans.</p> <p>This extends to working relationships between regional governments that are strained, often citing pollution in other sections of the river as a rationale for their inability to effectively address the issue, thereby neglecting the cumulative consequences of their specific jurisdiction. Local communities have also expressed concerns about this, citing that their regional governments have given up due to the river already being polluted.</p>"},{"location":"pollution/#issue-2-social-capital-and-challenges-towards-relocation","title":"Issue 2 - Social capital and Challenges towards relocation","text":"<p>Furthermore, the relocation of residents to public housing such as Rusanawas faces substantial challenges due to the influential role played by local communities in shaping policy decisions. The resistance to relocation from areas at risk is rooted in the communal and sentimental value attached to these rivers by the local community. This extends to communities that have been relocated, feeling like they have lost more by moving to a Rusanawa than by staying in a flood-prone area, particularly in the middle and downstream.</p> <p>The complexity is further heightened by unclear land ownership rights, complicating the resettlement process. Notably, the qualification for residency in public housing (Rusunawas). As the allocation of stays within a Rusnawa and compensation plans are based on being able to provide adequate proof of land ownership within areas that will be relocated, the majority of illegal settlers who have immigrated from other provinces may not be able to qualify for this scheme. This adds to the challenge of relocation, as local governments who want to resettle the population will face difficulties in distinguishing between legal and illegal settlers. If a forceful relocation is conducted, it may result in their displacement without an alternative place of residence, potentially leading to their return to the same riverbanks.</p>"},{"location":"prob/","title":"Problems Identified & Potential Solutions","text":""},{"location":"prob/#problems-and-solutions","title":"Problems and Solutions","text":""},{"location":"prob/#problems-identified","title":"Problems Identified","text":"<p>The first problem that we should address is the lack of a centralized form of government that prioritizes the health and management of the river. This will allow a coordinated effort in Kali Ciliwung to focus on a collective initiative for all regions instead of allowing regional needs or funding differences due to various justifications to hold priority. Secondly, there are proper incentives to incentivize settlers who are living in unsuitable areas to relocate. This will be particularly challenging as the team will need to take a multi-pronged approach to convince settlers who are so entrenched in their current culture and way of life. Lastly, a suitable sequence of implementation for relocation should be considered to minimize stresses from the redesign of green spaces on the population.</p>"},{"location":"prob/#local-solutions-that-have-proven-effective","title":"Local solutions that have proven effective","text":"<p>Although government help for clean-up has had challenges, Communities along Kali Ciliwung have been actively involved in the conservation, education, and clean-up efforts of Kali Ciliwung. One notable instance is the Komunitas Ciliwung Depok, which actively manages its local freshwater sources, partakes in farming for protection and conservation and educates Depok residents about the significance of Kali Ciliwung. These endeavours have effectively reduced river waste and fostered a more environmentally conscious community. Another case is Dompet Dhuafa and the downstream residents of Kali Ciliwung, who independently combat upstream pollution, promote tourism and innovate conservation methods without government assistance. Despite facing legal challenges, engaging local and international audiences, and experimenting with riverfront protection initiatives like bamboo projects, this community displays remarkable resilience in adverse conditions.</p> <p>These successes are potential solutions that can be utilized in the formulation of our overarching plans for the region, by leveraging the existing propensity of locals to participate in communal initiatives that include the promotion of tourism.</p>"},{"location":"prob/#singaporean-solutions-that-have-proven-effective","title":"Singaporean Solutions that have proven effective","text":"<p>As a guideline, the Singapore River cleanup can serve as a foundation for a more streamlined relocation strategy, beginning with the Housing Development Board (HDB) program for resettling inhabitants and concluding with the potential establishment of a dedicated tourism region facilitated by park connectors.</p> <p>The first policy we can explore is the overarching process of cleaning up the Kali Ciliwung River. This involves a multi-pronged approach that can be referenced. Spanning from 1977 to 1987, it focused on eliminating sources of pollution, clearing river debris, and establishing proper sewage infrastructure. Simultaneously, the government relocated more than 40,000 illegal squatters to HDBs, impacting over 26,000 families and providing monetary compensation as part of the pollution source removal efforts. Moreover, the cleanup initiative augmented land value around the river, leading to investments that catalyzed tourism and business activities. The development of areas like Marina Bay became possible due to the successful mitigation of pollution in the region. The process of relocation in the Singapore River can be mirrored in Kali Ciliwung, where the precedent of moving each stakeholder can be explored.</p> <p>The second policy we would explore tackles the housing of immigrants who are currently residing near river banks in Kali Ciliwung. The policy that we would like to incorporate is the Housing Development Board (HDB) program. Established in 1960, it addresses Singapore's housing shortage crisis by constructing simple, cost-effective apartments. This was done in response to issues such as overpopulation, high unemployment, and inadequate housing. In 1959, the HDB played a pivotal role in swiftly rehousing illegal settlers along the river. This initiative significantly improved living standards and contributed to the effective clean-up of the river, which can be explored to tackle the impasse of incentivizing settlers to move to proper housing. Additionally, we must take into consideration the issue of property rights among residents and illegal settlers. This will affect the quantity of housing that is required and the proper allocation and compensation schemes to be explored.</p> <p>Additionally, we can also consider that, with the resolution of illegal settlements and river pollution, Singapore implemented the Park Connector Network (PCN) to further enhance riverbanks. Introduced in 1992, the PCN has completed over 300 kilometres of park connectors, fostering recreational and social activities along water bodies. This initiative promotes environmental sustainability, reduces the local heat island effect, and provides habitats for native bird species, contributing positively to the ecosystem. The PCN has successfully encouraged community engagement through activities like jogging and cycling, creating a sense of belonging among residents. As the community in Kali Ciliwung already has successful clean-up initiatives and community engagement programs, we can explore leveraging this to foster a green corridor along with our \u201cSpecial Region\u201d plans.</p>"},{"location":"proposedsolution/","title":"Proposed Solutions","text":""},{"location":"proposedsolution/#proposed-solutions","title":"Proposed Solutions","text":"<p>Primarily, our team advocates for the establishment of a unified governing body for Kali Ciliwung, aspiring to elevate the river to the status of a national-level \"Special Region\" with distinct legal rights and living status. Drawing inspiration from Singapore's successful experience, this political maneuver aims to catalyze effective collaboration and policy implementation. Given Indonesia's challenge of fragmented river management across state boundaries, treating the entire river as a single entity empowers the governing body to set comprehensive guidelines and override lower political tiers. This strategic move lays the groundwork for achieving our broader objectives and exporting Singapore's successful strategies.</p> <p>Indonesia can draw valuable insights from Singapore's achievements, emphasizing pragmatic policies, forward-looking approaches, long-term planning, and political determination. Establishing a national-level \"Special Region\" for rivers could facilitate seamless long-term planning and development without hindrance from multiple government levels or stakeholders. Initial steps involve constructing additional public housing to accommodate illegal settlers. Subsequently, as the first phase concludes, the government can undertake river cleanup and relocate settlements to the newly built public housing. Finally, with housing shortages and river pollution addressed, the government can transform the riverbanks into community spaces akin to Singapore's Park Connector Network (PCN), enhancing social interaction and environmental sustainability. This approach makes the river more appealing to locals and tourists, contributing to increased tourism and economic development.</p>"},{"location":"proposedsolution/#additional-considerations-for-formulating-solutions","title":"Additional Considerations for Formulating Solutions","text":"<p>To address the issue of illegal settlers, our proposal involves the construction of additional public housing, similar to Singapore's historical approach along the Singapore River in 1977. Recognizing that illegal settlers often lack the same level of care for rivers as locals, relocating them paves the way for improved river management.</p> <p>To combat illegal home businesses and environmentally damaging factories along Kali Ciliwung, we advocate for the creation of dedicated industrial areas akin to Singapore's Jurong Industrial Area and Pasir Panjang Ports. A unified governing body facilitates the enforcement of rules, eliminating bribery and incentivizing positive behaviours. </p> <p>Relocating people along the river not only allows for the renewal of its state but also complements ongoing community cleanup and preservation efforts. This contributes to a cleaner river, reducing the severity of floods and refreshing the entire river community.</p> <p>Inspired by the positive response from kampongs around the Garuda Wall project, we propose building unified communities around the river, providing appropriate housing and recreational facilities. Implementing a Park Connector Network (PCN) system, similar to Singapore's, will link the country and create natural travel routes accessible by foot.</p> <p>Rather than relying on structures, we emphasize the use of PCNs and natural greenery to protect riverbanks from disasters. This approach addresses poor planning and design issues, creating natural safety distances and community-building opportunities.</p> <p>Empowering river communities, particularly downstream Ciliwung, involves providing opportunities for tourism and economic growth.
