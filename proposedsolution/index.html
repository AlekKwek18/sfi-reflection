<div><h1 id="proposed-solutions">Proposed Solutions</h1>
<p>Primarily, our team advocates for the establishment of a unified governing body for Kali Ciliwung, aspiring to elevate the river to the status of a national level "Special Region" with distinct legal rights and living status. Drawing inspiration from Singapore's successful experience, this political manoeuvre aims to catalyse effective collaboration and policy implementation. Given Indonesia's challenge of fragmented river management across state boundaries, treating the entire river as a single entity empowers the governing body to set comprehensive guidelines and override lower political tiers. This strategic move lays the groundwork for achieving our broader objectives and exporting Singapore's successful strategies.</p>
<p>Indonesia can draw valuable insights from Singapore's achievements, emphasizing pragmatic policies, forward-looking approaches, long-term planning, and political determination. Establishing a national-level "Special Region" for rivers could facilitate seamless long-term planning and development without hindrance from multiple government levels or stakeholders. Initial steps involve constructing additional public housing to accommodate illegal settlers. Subsequently, as the first phase concludes, the government can undertake river cleanup and relocate settlements to the newly built public housing. Finally, with housing shortages and river pollution addressed, the government can transform the riverbanks into community spaces akin to Singapore's Park Connector Network (PCN), enhancing social interaction and environmental sustainability. This approach makes the river more appealing to locals and tourists, contributing to increased tourism and economic development.</p>
<h2 id="one-united-government-at-the-national-level">One United Government at the National Level</h2>
<p>Firstly, our team believes in trying to achieve one united governing body for Kali Ciliwung. In this aspect, we intend to make the river a national level “Special Region” with its own legal rights and living status. This political move will create the impetus for effective collaboration and policy implementation without any barriers from multilevel governments or stakeholders. This lesson is one that Singapore had learnt through her years of rapid development. As the issue in Indonesia is poor co-management of the river across state boundaries and jurisdictions, having the entire river (including its pristine source) considered one entity allows the river governing body to set clear guidelines in river management and veto the lower political echelons. This sets the precedence for the rest of our goals of exporting Singapore’s successes.</p>
<h2 id="public-housing-and-relocation">Public Housing and Relocation</h2>
<p>The first step that should be taken is for the government to build more public housing to accommodate illegal settlers. We might not have spoken to illegal settlers but from our other interactions, we understand that illegal settlers live in precarious informal housing along Kaly Codi and Kaly Ciliwung due to the lack of formal legal housing. Similarly in Singapore, there were over 400,000 settlers along the Singapore river in 1977. As compared to locals, these settlers do not treat the rivers with the same level of care and respect. Additionally, their daily activities and habits, more often than not, pollute the environment around them. This is polar opposite from the Betawi culture that we understand from mid-stream and down-stream. By relocating settlers, we pave the way for better management of the river. </p>
<h2 id="setting-up-of-industries-and-stringent-enforcement">Setting up of Industries and Stringent Enforcement</h2>
<p>From our tour of Kali Ciliwung, we came to know of illegal home businesses that damage the environment. Further upstream, there are also factories which were blamed for the poor state of water and land surrounding the river. As industries are built on private lands, local communities have no choice but to endure the degradation of soil and water quality as a result of their advent. Businesses also engage in bribery to avoid facing repercussions of their actions. From our united government plans, this issue will be simpler to solve. We believe that industries should have their own areas to function in, like the Jurong Industrial Area and Pasir Panjang Ports if we were to compare to Singapore and how the country relocated shipyards, wholesalers, and home industries.</p>
<p>By having a unified governing body for the river, rules can be made and enforced much easier as compared to current situation. One good example is Mt Pagrango. The rangers have full authority over the nature park and this legality allows them to control and preserve the natural environment in Bogor.
More can be explored in this area for sure. For example, by removing legal loopholes and not incentivising negative behaviours.</p>
<h2 id="river-cleanups">River Cleanups</h2>
<p>Not only should we continue to educate and encourage behavioural change, but by relocating the people living and working along the river, we create opportunities to renew its state. By piggybacking on existing community cleanup and preservation efforts, we envision a river as clean as it was before. This has a two-fold benefit. One, the floods which were worsened due to pollution will be lessened. Two, the entire river community can be refreshed for our vision, elaborated in the next sections, to become a reality. Indonesia is better than Singapore in the past as we did not have local communities that were preserving the life of the river. It was only due to sheer political will and enforcement that we made progress (not to mention the initial failures). Hence, with the spirit of the locals in Indonesia, more can be done in shorter amounts of time.</p>
<h2 id="creating-communities">Creating Communities</h2>
<p>As we saw from the kampongs around the Garuda Wall project, the locals saw positivity in new situations. The best example of this is shown from the building of concrete structures as coastal protection. Although it interferes with their lives, they take advantage of the new structures to use as community facilities like new gathering grounds, which was truly astonishing to see. Hence, we wish to build unified communities around the river by providing appropriate housing and recreational facilities. In this aspect, we propose to link the country up with a Park Connector Network(PCN) system. This mirrors the PCNs of Singapore where we link towns together, creating beautiful and natural travel routes across the country, accessible by foot. Structures do not have to be boring and mundane; they can be integrated within the fabric of society and livelihood. It is not about “normalisation” or “naturalisation” but having a good blend of solutions. This also achieves our next two goals.</p>
<h2 id="protection-and-security">Protection and Security</h2>
<p>From the lava flows in Kali Code to the floods in Kali Ciliwung, we must address the need to secure the lives and property of the riverbanks. Instead of having structures, we hope that having PCNs and natural greenery can help alleviate damages to the riverbank. From our observations, space is not an issue. It is simply a design issue and poor planning that had led to terrible living conditions and constant threat of loss of lives and property from disasters. In downstream Ciliwung, the locals even showed us the structures that the governments built. Stretches of concrete walls that was built by chopping down natural greenery in the area -they are indeed “monuments of stupidity”. By adopting the PCN design, it creates natural safety distances and community building opportunities.</p>
<h2 id="tourism-and-empowering-the-locals">Tourism and Empowering the locals</h2>
<p>Speaking to the locals in Kali Code, we understand that most of the people living in river communities make a living by selling food or working blue-collared jobs. In Kali Ciliwung, we observe that the locals empower themselves in many aspects as mentioned in the front of our reflection, from education to preservation. The most salient example of empowerment is in downstream Ciliwung. We see their dreams and vision of transforming Ciliwung into a tourist destination that is known internationally. They are capable of conservation, water rescue, education, and many more useful skills that are necessary for tourism. There is so many missed opportunities for the people there when we compare them to river communities worldwide (e.g. Thailand). Empowering them to come out of the poverty cycle and to benefit from the rejuvenation of the rivers is a vision that we believe will happen, much like Singapore.</p></div>
