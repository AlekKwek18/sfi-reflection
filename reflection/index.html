  <h1>Reflection</h1>

<div><h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>From tiny droplets to expansive river deltas, the connection between water and river communities is deeply woven into the fabric of Indonesian life and has a profound impact on land policies in river governance. This influence is particularly pronounced in Kali Ciliwung, where the local population has adapted to annual floods, resisting relocation due to the river's sentimental value and community ties. This resistance extends to unsuccessful attempts to relocate settlers and corporate entities in the region, resulting in a decline in the river's environmental health and prospects for tourism. In this entry, we will delve into the potential consequences of redesigning green spaces, leading to distress migration and a potential decline in residents' quality of life. We will also explore how implementing various policies from Singapore could address these challenges and propose a game design to substantiate our hypotheses.</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>Also known as “Kali Besar” (Big River), Kali Ciliwung was a strategic location for trade since pre-colonial times in Batavia. The governance of the river from up to downstream is split between 3 municipal governments (refer to annex 1). Kali Ciliwung consists of 2 main tributaries, Kali Ciesek and Kali Ciluar, and it originates from Mt. Mandala Wangi which is governed by the Bogor Regency government. 
In Bogor, land use near its source heavily features agriculture and urban developments (refer to annexe 2). Pollution of Kali Ciliwung starts in this region where industrial, population, livestock and chemical wastes which come from its inhabitants contaminate its waters. This can be seen in the significant introduction of 185.62 kg/hr of BOD and 374.598 kg/hr of COD from liquid waste around Bogor alone (refer to annexe 3). Compared to its midstream which is governed by the Depok City government, although being one of West Java’s most populated cities contributes only 4.68 kg/hr of BOD and 7.56 kg/hr of COD. It’s downstream in DKI Jakarta which has a similar population constitution as Bogor contributes a lesser 23.4 kg/hr of BOD and 51.3 kg/hr of COD.</p>
<p>Despite the implementation of river clean-up initiatives by the three governing bodies in their respective regions, a 2017 report from the Jakarta Environmental Agency underscores the persistent and substantial pollution of Kali Ciliwung. Notably, 80% of the documented pollution is attributed to household or domestic waste. The situation is further compounded by annual floods impacting the mid and downstream regions, resulting in the deposition of trash along the riverbanks and posing a direct threat to the safety of informal settlements in these areas.</p>
<p>Efforts to address environmental degradation through the relocation of households have been a focal point for the governing bodies, particularly in areas prone to pollution and flooding. However, the successful execution of these policies is hindered by inadequate coordination. This lack of coordination stems from an unequal distribution of funding among the local governing bodies responsible for implementing relocation efforts. Examples of this are that the downstream region of Jakarta receives additional funding as The regional governments also encounter challenges in collaborative efforts, often citing pollution in other sections of the river as a rationale for their inability to effectively address the issue, thereby neglecting the cumulative consequences from their specific jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the relocation of residents faces substantial challenges due to the influential role played by local communities in shaping policy decisions. The resistance to relocation from areas at risk is rooted in the communal and sentimental value attached to these locations where social capital holds particular significance. Local governments who look to relocate residents often face community resistance through local leaders and very often need to compromise. 
The complexity is further heightened by unclear land ownership rights, complicating the resettlement process. Notably, the qualification for residency in public housing (Rusunawas). As the allocation of stay within a Rusnawa and compensation plans are based on being able to provide adequate proof of land ownership within areas that will be relocated, the majority of illegal settlers who have immigrated from other provinces may not be able to qualify for this scheme.  This adds to the challenge of relocation as local governments who want to resettle the population will face difficulties in distinguishing between legal and illegal settlers. The relocation of individuals may result in their displacement without an alternative place of residence, potentially leading to their return to the same riverbanks.</p>
<p>The lack of central coordination and the poor implementation of policies are pressing concerns in Kali Ciliwung, and we aim to explore how Singapore’s policies can be mirrored to aid in effective improvement. </p>
<p>Relevant Fieldwork
Our team drew our inspiration and project direction from a few notable interactions and workshops. This section provides a detailed insight into the perspectives that we gained from the different stakeholders. </p>
<p>Social Capital and Poor Governance
Unlike Singapore, where we practice a top-down approach of governance, Indonesia has a strong culture of people-oriented policies and people-led initiatives. This culture stems from having poor governing frameworks since independence and their people’s natural philosophy of life. For instance, in Jogja, the people can demand (with support from the Sultan) that a five-meter safety distance from Kali Code is sufficient, when the advised safety distance is more towards 20 meters. In Jakarta, we observed a similar phenomenon. The communities along Kali Ciliwung have been actively involved in the conservation, education, and clean up efforts of Kali Ciliwung without much support from the respective governments. When asked about the availability of support (monetary, policy, etc), the communities often mentioned that the inefficiency and inadequacy of their local governments to provide such support. The irony of this situation is that it was election season when we visited, and none of the candidates were even remotely interested in water governance and making improvements towards issues surrounding this. Hence, community spirit is paramount for communities to thrive in Indonesia. </p>
<p>One prominent example is Komunitas Ciliwung Depok, where they manage their local freshwater sources, engage in farming activities (for protection and conservation), and heavily educate the members of Depok on the importance of Kali Ciliwung. These efforts have proven to be effective in reducing waste going into the river and improving attitudes towards the environment. </p>
<p>Another example is Dompet Dhuafa and the locals downstream of Kali Ciliwung. They have been very active in fighting against upstream pollution in multiple ways, promoting tourism, and creating new ways of conservation - without support from their government. From fighting legal battles by themselves on multiple fronts, and engaging both local and international audiences, and trying new ways of protecting the riverfront (bamboo projects), we see the determination of this community when all odds are against them.</p>
<p>The last example is the “best conservation” village along Kali Code. All by themselves, they have rallied the locals in participating in the waste bank efforts. To fund their efforts, they engage in tourism and fundraising activities through their plastic artworks. Their work has led to drastically decreased pollution and heightened environmental awareness. However, once again, their work is limited to their own kampong without external oversight by the government.</p>
<p><continue here to describe how sg policies can be used tackle problems the game based on clds which aims find out best ways of implementation></continue></p>
<p>Firstly, our team believes in trying to achieve one united governing body for Kali Ciliwung. In this aspect, we intend to make the river a national level “Special Region” with its own legal rights and living status. This political move will create the impetus for effective collaboration and policy implementation. This lesson is one that Singapore had learnt through her years of rapid development. As the issue in Indonesia is poor co-management of the river across state boundaries and jurisdictions, having the entire river (including its pristine source) considered one entity allows the river governing body to set clear guidelines in river management and veto the lower political echelons. This sets the precedence for the rest of our goals of exporting Singapore’s successes.</p>
<p>Water governance entails proper management of not just the river body, but the activities surrounding the river. As inspired by the Singapore river cleanup, we must establish proper housing and trading guidelines (and facilities). This is to stop misuse of the river and areas around it. For Indonesia’s case, we must additionally ensure that proper riverbank protection is in place to protect against floods.</p>
<p>The clean-up of the Singapore River can provide a basis for a more efficient relocation strategy, public housing (Housing Development Board program) for the resettlement of inhabitants and the possibility of a special region for tourism through park connectors. The cleaning up of Singapore river took place from 1977 to 1987. The clean-up was focused on removing sources of pollution, removal of rubbish on the river and the building of a proper sewage infrastructure. In addition to the clean-up programme, the Singapore government had to relocate people to remove the pollution source. As a result, more than 40,000 illegal squatters were relocated to HDBs, affecting over 26,000 families, and were offered monetary compensation.  </p>
<p>The return on investment of the cleaning programme was a boon for Singapore. The programme boosted the nation’s image as a model city in urban planning and development. In addition, the clean-up effort increased the land value around the river and there were many investments made to attract tourism and business-related activates. The cleaning programme also exemplifies Singapore’s commitment in long term planning for the benefit of future generations. For instance, the Singapore’s Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) tunnel would not have been possible if the river have reminded heavily congested and polluted. </p>
<p>The Housing Development Board (HDB) was founded in 1960 to address the housing shortage in Singapore. In 1959, the country faced massive problems with a growing population, a high unemployment rate, and a shortage of sanitary housing. Most of the population lived in informal settlements and slums with poor sanitation and a lack of piped water. These led to the spread of diseases such as malaria and cholera, and the settlements were vulnerable to fire. As a result, HDB had to build simple but low-cost apartments that could be rapidly built to rehouse the illegal settlements. The policy worked successfully as most of the illegal settlers managed to be housed in proper accommodation, improving the standard of living in the country. The HDB was a huge factor in moving many squatters along the river, enabling the government to clean up the river effectively.</p>
<p>As the problem of illegal settlements and river pollution was resolved, Singapore took an additional step and implemented the Park Connector Network (PCN) to enhance the riverbank further. The PCN aims to create green corridors connecting local parks through water bodies such as rivers and reservoirs to foster recreational and social activities and increase biodiversity in urban areas. From the inception of PCN in 1992, Singapore has completed building over 300 kilometres of park connectors. PCN has mainly been successful in generating social and recreational activities within neighbourhoods. It serves as an alternative for activities such as jogging and cycling, thereby promoting a sense of belonging in the community. In addition, PCN promotes environmental sustainability as the large areas of greenery help to reduce the impact of the local heat island effect. The greenery also provided habitats for native bird species, promoting a positive impact on the ecosystem.</p>
<p>Therefore, Indonesia could take inspiration and lessons from Singapore’s success through pragmatic policies, a forward-looking approach, long-term planning and political will. Having a national-level “Special Region” for the rivers could foster long-term planning and development around the river without any barriers from multilevel governments or stakeholders. At the first level, the government should build more public housing to accommodate the illegal settlers. Once the first level has been completed, the government could then start cleaning up the rivers and relocating the illegal settlements to the newly completed public housing. Lastly, once the problem of housing shortage and river pollution is resolved, the government can convert the riverbank into a place similar to PCN in Singapore to help promote social interaction and environmental sustainability. In this way, the river will be more attractive to the locals and tourists alike, helping to attract more tourists and improve the local economy.</p>
<p>To illustrate the problem, we will develop a physical board game to highlight the complex issues surrounding water governance in river communities. Players will be engaged in critical thinking and problem-solving as they navigate managing a river ecosystem, addressing pollution, and handling community resistance to relocation. They will also promote awareness and understanding of sustainable solutions for river ecosystems.</p>

<p>Water governance in Asia, particularly in regions like Indonesia, presents a complex and multifaceted challenge. This reflection delves into the various aspects of water governance, examining the similarities and differences between Indonesia and Singapore, the challenges faced in regions like Kali Code and Kali Ciliwung, and the underlying factorsß contributing to the current state of water management. It also highlights community engagement and the potential for improvement, as seen in initiatives like Waste Bank and the efforts of the Dompet and Depok communities.</p>
<p>Indonesia and Singapore: A Comparative Perspective</p>
<p>At the outset, it's essential to understand that comparing Indonesia and Singapore in terms of water governance might seem like comparing apples and oranges. Singapore, a small city-state, has made remarkable strides in water management, transforming its limited water resources into a sustainable and efficient system through technology, strict regulations, and community engagement. On the other hand, Indonesia, with its vast and diverse landscape, faces a different set of challenges. The archipelago's water governance issues are deeply intertwined with its social, economic, and political fabrics.</p>
<p>Challenges in Kali Code and Kali Ciliwung</p>
<p>In regions like Kali Code and Kali Ciliwung, the challenges are starkly visible. Poor housing conditions along these rivers are not just a result of inadequate urban planning but also a manifestation of deeper socio-economic issues. The blame-shifting between upstream and downstream stakeholders reflects a fragmented approach to water governance. Upstream communities often don't see or feel the impact of their activities on downstream regions, leading to a lack of accountability and cooperation.</p>
<p>Community Engagement: A Silver Lining</p>
<p>Despite these challenges, there's an observable affinity of the local communities towards their rivers. Initiatives like the Waste Bank in Kali Code and the activities of the Dompet and Depok communities in Kali Ciliwung are commendable. These community-driven efforts showcase a deep-rooted respect and love for the rivers, transcending the mere utilitarian value of these water bodies. Such initiatives are crucial in building a sense of ownership and responsibility among the local populace, which is essential for sustainable water governance.</p>
<p>Industrial and Domestic Pollution: A Persistent Threat</p>
<p>The unregulated industrial activities and home businesses significantly contribute to the pollution of these rivers. The lack of stringent regulations or their enforcement allows for unchecked pollution, turning these water bodies into dumping grounds for industrial waste. This situation is exacerbated by the inadequate waste management systems at the domestic level, further contributing to the deteriorating health of the rivers.</p>
<p>Hope in the Horizon: The Unadulterated Springs of Mt Merapi and Mt Pagrango</p>
<p>Amid these challenges, there remains a glimmer of hope. The main sources of water springs in Mt Merapi and Mt Pagrango are still unadulterated. These pristine water sources symbolize the potential of Indonesia's natural resources and the possibility of rejuvenating its water bodies. Protecting these sources from contamination and over-exploitation is critical in ensuring a sustainable water future for the region.</p>
<p>Towards a Sustainable Future</p>
<p>To move towards a sustainable water governance model, Indonesia can take cues from Singapore's success. Key areas of focus should include:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Integrated Water Resource Management (IWRM): Adopting a holistic approach that considers the entire water cycle, encompassing both upstream and downstream stakeholders.</p>
